           <table>
	<tr><td> 1. Before we begin making sambar, it always helps to soak tamarind in water earlier. So soak 1 tablespoon tamarind in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.</td><tr>
	<td><center><img src="tamarind-pulp-(3)-3-190166.jpg" width="150" height="150"></center></td>
	<tr><td>2. Once the tamarind gets soft, then squeeze the tamarind in the water itself. Discard the strained tamarind and keep the tamarind pulp aside.</td><tr>
	<td><center><img src="How-To-Make-Tamarind-Water-4154.jpg" width="250" height="250"></center></td>
	<tr><td>3. Rinse ½ cup tuvar dal (100 grams) a couple of times in fresh and clean water. You can use a strainer to rinse the lentils. For quick cooking of the lentils you can opt to soak them for an hour prior to cooking.I recommend to make your sambar recipe with unpolished tuvar dal for a really good taste and more nutrition.</td></tr>
	<td><center><img src="tuvar dal" width="250" height="250"></center></td>
	<tr><td>4. Drain all the water and add the dal in a 2 litre stovetop pressure cooker. Also add ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder.</td></tr>
	<td><center><img src="toor-dal-tadka-step-1-9.jpg" width="250" height="250"></center></td>
	<tr><td>5. Add 1.5 to 1.75 cups of water and mix to combine.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>6. Cover and pressure cook dal for 7 to 8 whistles or 9 to 10 minutes on medium heat.</th></tr>
	<tr><td>7. When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and check the dal. The dal should be completely cooked and mushy. Mash the dal with a spoon or wired whisk. Cover and keep aside. You can see the consistency of dal in the picture below.</td></tr>
	<td><center><img src="mash dal" width="250" height="250"></center></td>
	<tr><td>8. When the dal is pressure cooking – rinse, peel and chop the vegetables. When making sambar, chop the vegetables which get cooked faster in large sizes like pumpkin, brinjals(small aubergines) okra, drumsticks etc.Vegetables which take more time to cook are to be chopped in small sizes like carrots, potatoes, etc. I have chopped the pumpkin in large cubes and the carrots 		and potatoes in small cubes.Chop the brinjals before you add them in the pan or else they darken. You will need 1 to 1.5 cup of chopped vegetables.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>9. Take 1 to 1.5 cups chopped vegetables in a pan or pot. Also add 6 to 7 pearl onions or 1 small to medium onion (thickly sliced) and 1 small to medium tomato 			(quartered).</td></tr>
	<td><center><img src="vegetables in pressure cooker" width="250" height="250"></center></td>
	<tr><td>10. Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, ¼ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder and salt as per taste.
	Adding kashmiri red chili powder is optional and can be skipped. I add it for a nice bright color in the sambar.</td></tr>
	<td><center><img src="tadka" width="250" height="250"></center></td>
	<tr><td>11. Add 1.5 to 2 cups water and stir. Add enough water so that they cover the vegetables.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>12. Keep the pan on a stove top and begin to cook vegetables on a medium-low to medium heat. In between do check when the vegetables are cooking.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>13. Cook till the vegetables are almost done. Ensure that you don’t overcook the vegetables.</th></tr>
	<tr><td>14. Add the prepared tamarind pulp to the cooked vegetables. If you don’t have dried tamarind then use packaged or bottled tamarind paste.You can add about ½ to 1 tablespoon of the tamarind paste or add as according to your taste.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>15.Next add 1 to 1.5 tablespoons Sambar Powder. At this step you can also add ½ to 1 teaspoon of jaggery powder. Adding jaggery is optional.The flavor of your sambar mostly depends upon the sambar powder that you will be using. So either make your own homemade sambar powder or use a trusted brand. You can buy packaged sambar powder easily 			online.</td></tr><tr><td>18. Add the mashed dal.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>19. Simmer on a medium-low heat till it comes to a boil. Stir at intervals. You will see a frothy layer on top when the sambar begins boiling.
	At this step switch off the heat. Cover and keep aside. Check the taste and add salt if needed.</td></tr>
	<td><center><img src="sambar" width="250" height="250"></center></td>
	<tr><td>20. In a small pan or tadka pan, heat 2 tablespoons gingelly oil (oil made from raw sesame seeds).
	You can even use sunflower oil, ghee or coconut oil instead. Add ½ teaspoon mustard seeds. Immediately add this tempering mixture in the hot sambar. Cover the pan with its lid for 4 to 	5 minutes, so that the aroma and flavors from the tempering mixture get infused with the sambar.</td></tr>
